-The philosphy
-- make something small but SOLID and specially OpenClose.

Mission
-a 1:SOLID 2:string interpreter to convert equation in a string into objects for iqra framework. Just the linear segment (no fractions).
    - superscripts
    - subscripts
    - square root
    - underline
    - over line
    - special chars -later
    - chars with special sizes / attributes (large sqrt, brackets);
How can this be solid - Create a basic framewrok that can take in more and more command options- they can be pluggen into that.


- The framework just find triggers and call the callback
